A desktop voice assistant with a custom, animated GUI built using Python and Pygame. It understands voice commands to perform tasks, fetch live data from APIs, and control desktop applications, inspired by advanced personal assistants like "Nova".

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get your own copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

You must have **Python 3** installed on your system.

### 2. Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Rahul-kr1623/Python-Voice-Assistant.git](https://github.com/Rahul-kr1623/Python-Voice-Assistant.git)
    cd Python-Voice-Assistant
    ```

2.  **Install all required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install speechrecognition wikipedia pywhatkit pyjokes requests pygame winshell
    ```

3.  **Create your configuration file:**
    In the main project folder, create a new file named `config.py`.

4.  **Add your secrets to `config.py`:**
    You must add your own OpenWeatherMap API key and contact list for the assistant to work.

    ```python
    # Inside config.py
    
    WEATHER_API_KEY = "your_own_api_key_from_openweathermap"
    
    CONTACTS = {
        "mummy": "+911234567890",
        "dad": "+911234567891"
